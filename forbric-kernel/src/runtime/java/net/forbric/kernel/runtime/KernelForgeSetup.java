/**
 * The game side of a traditional-MinecraftForge setup phase: post one mod-lifecycle event at every MinecraftForge
 * mod, then run what they deferred.
 *
 * <h2>What moving here bought, beyond the usual</h2>
 *
 * <p>The boot side used to take the event and its {@code ModLoadingStage} as two INDEPENDENT strings and pair
 * them at each of eleven call sites. Nothing related them. A crossed pair — {@code FMLLoadCompleteEvent} with
 * {@code COMMON_SETUP} — compiles, posts, and delivers the wrong stage's deferred queue, so the work one phase
 * filed runs at another phase or not at all. Every event belongs to exactly one stage, and now the pairing lives
 * in one place where javac checks both halves: {@link #stageOf} is exhaustive over the events this kernel posts,
 * and {@link #post} cannot name a constructor that does not exist.
 *
 * <p>Two smaller facts the reflective version could not report. All six constructors are {@code public} — the
 * boot side called {@code getDeclaredConstructor} and {@code setAccessible(true)} on them, which was never
 * needed and would have gone on hiding a genuine visibility change. And {@code DeferredWorkQueue.runTasks} is
 * public API on {@code ModLoadingStage.getDeferredWorkQueue()}, not the {@code Object}-typed hop it used to be.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is safe to link on a dedicated server</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link FMLClientSetupEvent} is named here and a dedicated server loads this class. That is checked, not
 * assumed: disassembled, that event declares only {@code getBus} and its constructor, extends
 * {@code ParallelDispatchEvent}, and its constant pool names no client type at all. The client-only event in
 * this kernel is NeoForge's client TICK, which is why that one lives in a class of its own.
 *
 * <p>The other half of that guard is the caller's: {@code KernelForgeModContext.fireSetupPhase} returns before
 * naming this class when no MinecraftForge mod was published, and mods are published only where
 * {@code KernelForgeModContext.available} held. A NeoForge-only instance therefore never loads this at all.

	 *
	 * <p>Per-mod isolation, as genuine FML does: it collects these rather than dying on the first, and one mod's
	 * broken setup must not cost every mod after it the same phase.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The deferred queue is half the work.</b> {@code ParallelDispatchEvent.enqueueWork} does not run the
	 * runnable; it files it on the {@code DeferredWorkQueue} the {@code ModLoadingStage} itself owns. Posting the
	 * event without draining that queue delivers the event and still runs none of the work — which for
