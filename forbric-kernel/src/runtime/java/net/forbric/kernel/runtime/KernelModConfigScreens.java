/**
 * Opens a mod's config screen, whichever ecosystem it came from.
 *
 * <h2>Why three answers and not one</h2>
 *
 * <p>There is no cross-loader config screen SPI, and the three that exist do not resemble each other. NeoForge
 * registers an {@code IConfigScreenFactory} as an extension point on the mod's container. Traditional
 * MinecraftForge registers a {@code ConfigScreenHandler.ConfigScreenFactory} record holding a
 * {@code BiFunction<Minecraft, Screen, Screen>}. Fabric has no config SPI at all — Fabric mods register with
 * <em>Mod Menu</em>, which is itself a mod, so the registry lives in a class this kernel cannot compile against
 * and may not be installed.
 *
 * <p>Each screen therefore answers for its own family and no other. That is why Mod Menu opens Fabric mods'
 * configs and nothing else: it asks its own registry, which only Fabric mods can register in. Nothing is wrong
 * with it. The answer for an instance running three loaders is to ask all three registries, which is this class.
 *
 * <h2>Linkage</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each family's lookup is typed, and lives in its own nested class so that it LOADS on its own. A single
 * method naming both families would fail to link on an instance carrying one of them, and the failure would be a
 * {@code NoClassDefFoundError} when a player clicks Config — for a mod of the family that IS present. Mod Menu
 * stays reflective because it is a third-party mod, not a staged artifact.
