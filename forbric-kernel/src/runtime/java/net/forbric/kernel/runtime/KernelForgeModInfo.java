/**
 * The {@code IModInfo} a kernel-manufactured TRADITIONAL-Forge container carries.
 *
 * <p>Traditional Forge and NeoForge each have their own {@code IModInfo} — {@code net.minecraftforge.forgespi.*}
 * against {@code net.minecraftforge.forgespi.*} — so this is a separate type from {@link KernelModInfo}, not a
 * parameterisation of it. The two interfaces happen to be close in shape here, but nothing guarantees they stay
 * that way and a shared implementation could not name both.
 *
 * <h2>The asymmetry this class made visible</h2>
 *
 * <p>It replaces a {@link java.lang.reflect.Proxy} that named 12 of this interface's 14 methods and sent the rest
 * to a {@code defaultReturn}. The two it did not name are {@link #getConfig()} and {@link #getOwningFile()} — and
 * those are precisely the two that the NEOFORGE twin ({@link KernelModInfo}) makes non-null, each with a comment
 * naming the crash that taught it.
 *
 * <p>That is a striking coincidence and it is NOT the obvious story. The obvious story would be "the lesson was
 * learned on one side and never carried to the other", and it is wrong: the Forge side DID carry it, in
 * {@code PassiveSeeder.buildForgeModInfo}, which builds real {@code moddiscovery.ModInfo} records with a non-null
 * config and a real owning file whose license is {@code ""} — with a comment saying the Mods screen writes the
 * license into its info pane unguarded. Two different objects answer "what is this mod's info": the seeded record
 * and this one. Only the first ever reaches Forge's own readers.
 *
 * <p>Which is why both still return null here. Every non-constructor caller in traditional Forge that
 * dereferences these reads {@code ModList.SORTED_LIST}, and {@code SORTED_LIST} is a {@code private static final}
 * assigned once in {@code ModList.<clinit>} from {@code LoadingModList}; {@code ModList.setLoadedMods}, which is
 * what the kernel calls, writes {@code mods}/{@code sortedContainers}/{@code indexedMods} and cannot touch it.
 * The mods GUI never asks a container for its {@code IModInfo} at all — {@code getModInfo} appears zero times in
 * {@code ModListScreen}, its info panel, and the list widget.
 *
 * <p>And for {@link #getOwningFile()} there is a second, stronger reason not to guess: the one site that would
 * want a non-null value, {@code ModListScreen.updateCache}, follows it with a {@code checkcast} to the CONCRETE
 * {@code moddiscovery.ModFileInfo}. A file info written here would fail that cast, turning an NPE into a
 * ClassCastException — which is not a fix. The only answer that would count is handing over the real
 * {@code ModFileInfo} the seeder already built for that jar, and that is a wiring change between two components,
 * not a line in this file.
