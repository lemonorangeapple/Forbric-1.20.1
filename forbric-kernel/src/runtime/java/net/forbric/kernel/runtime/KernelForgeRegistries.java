/**
 * The game side of traditional MinecraftForge's {@code RegisterEvent}: which registries it is posted for, and how
 * one is built and posted.
 *
 * <p>The dispatch LOOP is not here. It stays boot-side in {@code KernelForgeModContext.dispatchIsolated}, where
 * it names no game type and can therefore be driven by a test with fakes — the per-(registry, mod) isolation is
 * the property most worth asserting and there is no other way to assert it off-game.
 *
 * <h2>What is still reflective, and why</h2>
 *
 * <p>Three members are not public, and naming a non-public member is reflection whichever side you stand on.
 * What moving here buys is that every TYPE around them is checked, so a renamed or re-signatured class is a build
 * failure rather than a {@code NoSuchMethodException} at the moment every MinecraftForge mod registers nothing:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code RegisterEvent}'s 3-arg constructor is package-private. Its parameter TYPES are now written out
 *       and checked; only its existence is a runtime question.</li>
 *   <li>{@code ForgeRegistry.getWrapper()} is package-private and returns the package-private
 *       {@code NamespacedWrapper} — a type no code outside that package can name, on either side.</li>
 *   <li>{@code RegistryManager.registries} is package-private. {@code registryView} beside it is public but
 *       holds {@code IForgeRegistry}, and the event wants the {@code ForgeRegistry} implementation.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The {@code BuiltInRegistries} walk stays a field enumeration on purpose: there are ~80 of them, listing
 * them by hand would be a list that goes stale silently, and {@code Registry.class.isAssignableFrom} checks the
 * type of every field it accepts.
