/**
 * NeoForge's {@code ScreenEvent.Opening} and {@code Closing}, posted from the merged {@code Gui.setScreen}.
 *
 * <p>The merge kept MinecraftForge's {@code setScreen}, which asks MinecraftForge's Opening and Closing and never
 * NeoForge's, so a NeoForge mod that swaps or refuses a screen did nothing: Controlling never replaced the key binds
 * screen, JEI never learned a screen opened, Balm and PuzzlesLib never saw one change. NeoScreenEventsInjector calls in
 * right after MinecraftForge's own hooks. MinecraftForge is asked first and its refusal is final; NeoForge then sees
 * MinecraftForge's choice as the new screen and decides last — a cancel, a replacement, or null to close.
 *
 * <p>The replacement is carried from the post to the assignment through one field: {@code setScreen} runs on the
 * render thread, and a listener that opens another screen re-enters and finishes inside the post, before it is set.
