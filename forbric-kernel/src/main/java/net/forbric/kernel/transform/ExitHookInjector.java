/**
 * Calls {@link net.forbric.kernel.interop.ClientShutdown#stopLeakedBackgroundExecutors} at each side's end of life —
 * every return of {@code Minecraft.close()} on the client, of {@code DedicatedServer.onServerExit()} on the
 * dedicated server — so a JVM whose config file-watchers grew a non-daemon executor during the session can still
 * end. On a client that executor holds the process open until vanilla's 15-second shutdown watchdog crashes it;
 * a dedicated server has no watchdog and no {@code System.exit} at all, so it just sits there forever after
 * "Stopping server" (the gates had been quietly killing it after their grace period).
 *
 * <p>The previous-generation loader reached the client half through a mixin
 * ({@code ForbricClientShutdownMixin}, in its {@code forbric-neoforge-bridge.mixins.json}) — and the kernel never
 * applies that loader's mixin configs, so under the kernel the hook had never run once; this injector is how it
 * runs now, and the hook itself is a kernel class. Nothing noticed for a long time because night-config's
 * executors only get a thread when a watched config file actually changes; the runs where one did, hung.
 * FML's own shutdown would close these watchers; the kernel drives both loaders' lifecycles and does not run it.
 *
 * <p>The call takes the hooked class's loader (the game loader): night-config lives on the parent and is reached
 * by delegation, MinecraftForge's config handler is a game class and is reached directly. No branch target is
 * added, so every original stack map frame stays valid.
