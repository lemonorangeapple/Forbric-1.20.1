/**
 * The kernel's native traditional-MinecraftForge per-mod loading context: a {@code BusGroup} +
 * {@code FMLModContainer} + {@code FMLJavaModLoadingContext} triple, manufactured without any FancyModLoader
 * discovery / module-layer / sorting machinery.
 *
 * <p>Traditional Forge differs from NeoForge in every joint the kernel touches, which is why it needs its own
 * factory rather than {@link KernelModContainerFactory}:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>events run on EventBus 7 — a per-mod {@code BusGroup} with a {@code startup()} gate — not an
 *       {@code IEventBus};</li>
 *   <li>a {@code @Mod} class is constructed with an {@code FMLJavaModLoadingContext}, not with
 *       ({@code IEventBus}, {@code Dist}, {@code ModContainer});</li>
 *   <li>{@code RegisterEvent} is the 3-arg {@code (key, ForgeRegistry, Registry)} flavour, posted per
 *       {@code BusGroup}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both {@code FMLModContainer} and {@code FMLJavaModLoadingContext} have only loader-facing constructors
 * (taking a {@code ModFileScanData} + {@code ModuleLayer} the kernel deliberately does not have), so instances are
 * allocated with Forge's own {@code UnsafeHacks} and the fields the mod-facing API actually reads are filled in by
 * hand. Fields normally initialized by the skipped constructor ({@code configs}, {@code extensionPoints},
 * {@code activityMap}, {@code dependencies}) must be seeded or the first mod that calls {@code addConfig} /
 * {@code registerExtensionPoint} NPEs.
 *
 * <p>This is the recipe {@link KernelForgeBaseline} proved on {@code net.minecraftforge.common.ForgeMod}; it lives
 * here so real third-party Forge {@code @Mod}s ({@link KernelModLoader}) get the same genuine context instead of
 * the {@code null} they used to receive.

	 *
	 * <p>Targets are computed once and reused across registries: the enumeration walks EVERY registry in
	 * {@code BuiltInRegistries} — with its Forge wrapper when one exists and a null wrapper when it does not, which
	 * is what genuine {@code GameData.postRegisterEvents} does — plus every Forge-CUSTOM registry in
	 * {@code RegistryManager.ACTIVE} (forge:fluid_type, holder_set_type, the modifier serializers, …), which are
	 * absent from {@code BuiltInRegistries} and so invisible to the first loop. The vanilla-only half matters:
