/**
 * Rebinds a guest injector from a merge-added DELEGATING STUB to the method that carries the body it wants.
 *
 * <p>NeoForge's patch of {@code SimpleContainer.setItem(int, ItemStack)} moved the body — including the
 * {@code setChanged()} call — into a new {@code setItem(int, ItemStack, boolean)} and left the vanilla-shaped
 * method as {@code aload/iload/aload/iconst_0/invokevirtual setItem(…Z)V/return}. fabric-transfer-api-v1's
 * {@code SimpleContainerMixin} selects the vanilla shape by explicit descriptor and {@code @Redirect}s the
 * {@code setChanged()} inside it; on the merged base the call is not there, the mixin reads PARTIAL, and every
 * hopper or pipe transfer through a Fabric mod spams {@code setChanged} for each intermediate step. The same
 * shape hits {@code BaseContainerBlockEntity.setItem}.
 *
 * <p>Rule R1: an injector whose selector carries an explicit descriptor and resolves to a method that is a pure
 * delegating stub — loads, constants, argument construction ({@code NEW/DUP/INVOKESPECIAL <init>/CHECKCAST}),
 * exactly one call to a same-owner same-name method with a different descriptor, and a return; no branch —
 * whose {@code @At} member is absent from the stub but present in that delegate, has its selector rewritten to
 * the delegate, provided the handler does not depend on the stub's parameter list: {@code @At}-driven kinds
 * ({@code @Redirect}, {@code @WrapOperation}, {@code @ModifyArg(s)}, {@code @ModifyExpressionValue},
 * {@code @ModifyReturnValue}, {@code @ModifyConstant}, {@code @WrapWithCondition}) whose captures of the target's
 * arguments, if any, the stub passes to the delegate in place (MixinStubRebind's rule, shared), or an {@code @Inject}
 * that captures nothing or exactly the delegate's parameters; and every {@code @Local} sugar parameter must name a
 * type the delegate's own parameters carry (fabric-content-registries' {@code FuelValuesMixin} captures the
 * {@code HolderLookup.Provider} and {@code FeatureFlagSet} that only the stub has, so it is left alone).
 *
 * <p>The rewrite is applied to the {@link ClassNode} Mixin receives from the bytecode provider
 * ({@code ForbricMixinService.getClassNode}), never to jar bytes: the plan is computed once by
 * {@link KernelGuestMixinAdapter} when it sees the PARTIAL verdict, kept only if the rewritten mixin re-evaluates
 * better, and remembered by the mixin's internal name. {@code -Dforbric.mixinRetarget=off} computes no plan and
 * edits nothing — the PARTIAL lines return exactly as before.

	 * Rule R6: an {@code @Inject} whose {@code @At(INVOKE)} names a call the surviving carrier SUBSTITUTED — the method
	 * kept its body, instruction for instruction and local for local, and makes a different call taking the same
	 * arguments at that one instruction ({@link MergedBaseCalleeSwaps#SUBSTITUTED}) — has its point moved to the call
	 * the merged body makes. The selector stays, and with it everything the handler is bound to: the method's
	 * arguments, its callback, and the locals at that instruction, which the row's census proves are the ones the mod
	 * was compiled against.
	 *
	 * <p>NeoForge substituted {@code UnbakedModelParser.parse} for {@code CuboidModel.fromStream} in
	 * {@code ModelManager.lambda$loadBlockModels$2}, which parses each block-model file. fusion's MinecraftForge build
	 * records the id of the model about to be parsed BEFORE {@code fromStream}, and its hook in the vanilla model
	 * deserializer names every fusion model it builds with that id (the connected-texture models Rechiseled and
	 * Anti-Blocks ship). The anchor missed and the handler attached nowhere, so every fusion model was built as
	 * {@code fusion:unknown} and its warnings and bake errors named that instead of the file; and since fusion requires
	 * its mixins, a STRICT client asked to continue or quit on every launch.
	 *
	 * <p>R2 cannot take this: its rows keep the callee's descriptor, because the kinds it moves are shaped by the
	 * callee. Only an {@code @Inject} follows a substitution, since its handler sees neither the call's arguments nor
	 * its result, only the point. And only with no slice, {@code @Group}, sugar, parameter annotation or {@code @At}
	 * args; a shift of BEFORE or AFTER and no ordinal past the first (the row's call is made once); for a mod of an
	 * ecosystem the row lists (the others were compiled against the replacement, or against neither, and miss natively
	 * too); in a mixin with one target. A handler that captures locals moves only when the live method's local variable
	 * table holds exactly those at the new call ({@link InsertedLambdaArgumentShim#localsAtCall}) — Mixin reads the same
	 * table to decide what it captures; with no table there is no proof and the point stays.
	 *
	 * <p>The handler then runs where it never ran on this base, and a {@code LinkageError} from it — code compiled
	 * against another base — is not an {@code Exception}: in the one row's method it would escape the per-file catch,
	 * fail the whole resource reload, and a failed reload drops every resource pack. So the move also puts the handler
	 * behind a guard ({@link Element#GUARD}) that says so once and skips it, which is where things stood before the
	 * move. {@code -Dforbric.mixinRetarget.substitutedCall=off} leaves every such point as compiled, and
	 * {@code -Dforbric.mixinRetarget.substitutedCall.guard=off} moves it without the guard.
